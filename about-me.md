My name is Brandon Dean, and I am a Data Analytics and Machine Learning major at the Ball State University Co outer Science Department. I love working with programming languages. 

* I have used JavaScript, C, HTML/CSS, and mostly Python in my experience creating software. I am most proficient in Python and JavaScript as these are the most used within the BSU Computer Science Department.

* I have done most of my coding in classes as this is where I have learned how to use these languages; however, I have done a lot more Python coding in personal projects. In my job, I read and use HTML/CSS for diagnosing issues that arise from websites, causing people to have issues.

* The largest program I have worked on was a Machine Learning agent utilizing MiniMax algorithms to create a Machine Learning agent to play Checkers.

* I feel most comfortable doing backend work in coding, such as algorithms and functions, as GUIs can be difficult due to graphics and long, tedious work specifying placements of objects. Not only this, but my perfectionism causes me to spend long hours trying to make it perfect.
